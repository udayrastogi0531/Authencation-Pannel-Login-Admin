# Deployment Guide

This guide covers different ways to deploy your Beautiful Authentication System.

## Quick Deploy Options

### 1. Netlify (Recommended)
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Drag and drop the `dist` folder to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
3. Your app is live!

### 2. Vercel
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run: `vercel`
3. Follow the prompts

### 3. GitHub Pages
1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Push the `dist` folder to a `gh-pages` branch
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings

## Manual Deployment

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with optimized files ready for deployment.

### Environment Variables
For production, you may need to set environment variables:

```bash
# Example for different environments
VITE_APP_ENV=production
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.com
```

## Server Configuration

### Nginx
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    root /path/to/dist;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

### Apache
```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName your-domain.com
    DocumentRoot /path/to/dist
    
    <Directory /path/to/dist>
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteBase /
        RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Enable Gzip Compression
Most hosting providers enable this by default.

### 2. Set Cache Headers
Configure your server to cache static assets.

### 3. Use a CDN
Consider using a CDN for better global performance.

## Security Considerations

### 1. HTTPS
Always use HTTPS in production.

### 2. Environment Variables
Never commit sensitive data to version control.

### 3. Content Security Policy
Consider implementing CSP headers.

## Monitoring

### 1. Error Tracking
Consider integrating with services like Sentry.

### 2. Analytics
Add Google Analytics or similar for usage tracking.

### 3. Performance Monitoring
Use tools like Lighthouse for performance monitoring.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Blank page after deployment**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify all assets are loading correctly

2. **Routing issues**
   - Ensure your server is configured for SPA routing
   - Check the server configuration examples above

3. **Environment variables not working**
   - Verify variables start with `VITE_`
   - Check if they're properly set in your hosting platform
